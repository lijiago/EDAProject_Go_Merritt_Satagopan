Metadata: Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity Burned Area Boundaries (Feature Layer)

{"accessLevel": "public", "bureauCode": ["005:96"], "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "USFSEnterpriseContent", "hasEmail": "mailto:SM.FS.data@usda.gov"}, "description": "The Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity MTBS project assesses the frequency, extent, and magnitude (size and severity) of all large wildland fires (includes wildfire, wildland fire use, and prescribed fire) in the conterminous United States (CONUS), Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico from the beginning of the Landsat Thematic Mapper archive to the present.  All fires reported as greater than 1,000 acres in the western U.S. and greater than 500 acres in the eastern U.S. are mapped across all ownerships. MTBS produces a series of geospatial and tabular data for analysis at a range of spatial, temporal, and thematic scales and are intended to meet a variety of information needs that require consistent data about fire effects through space and time. This map layer is a vector polygon of the location of all currently inventoried and mappable MTBS fires occurring between calendar year 1984 and the current MTBS release for CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Please visit https://mtbs.gov/announcements to determine the current release.\u00a0 Fires omitted from this mapped inventory are those where suitable satellite imagery was not available or fires were not discernable from available imagery. <a href='https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.MTBS_BURN_AREA_BOUNDARY.xml' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>Metadata</a>", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "accessURL": "https://data-usfs.hub.arcgis.com/maps/usfs::monitoring-trends-in-burn-severity-burned-area-boundaries-feature-layer", "format": "Web Page", "mediaType": "text/html", "title": "ArcGIS Hub Dataset"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "accessURL": "https://apps.fs.usda.gov/arcx/rest/services/EDW/EDW_MTBS_01/MapServer/63", "format": "ArcGIS GeoServices REST API", "mediaType": "application/json", "title": "ArcGIS GeoService"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "accessURL": "https://data-usfs.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/usfs::monitoring-trends-in-burn-severity-burned-area-boundaries-feature-layer.geojson?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A4269%2C%22wkid%22%3A4269%7D", "format": "GeoJSON", "mediaType": "application/vnd.geo+json", "title": "GeoJSON"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "accessURL": "https://data-usfs.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/usfs::monitoring-trends-in-burn-severity-burned-area-boundaries-feature-layer.csv?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A4269%2C%22wkid%22%3A4269%7D", "format": "CSV", "mediaType": "text/csv", "title": "CSV"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "accessURL": "https://data-usfs.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/usfs::monitoring-trends-in-burn-severity-burned-area-boundaries-feature-layer.kml?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A4269%2C%22wkid%22%3A4269%7D", "format": "KML", "mediaType": "application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml", "title": "KML"}, {"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "accessURL": "https://data-usfs.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/usfs::monitoring-trends-in-burn-severity-burned-area-boundaries-feature-layer.zip?outSR=%7B%22latestWkid%22%3A4269%2C%22wkid%22%3A4269%7D", "format": "ZIP", "mediaType": "application/zip", "title": "Shapefile"}], "identifier": "https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=847db1a51b0c4bb0a3663bcbce32ccb1&sublayer=63", "issued": "2017-05-04", "keyword": ["NGDA", "National Geospatial Data Asset", "Land Use Land Cover Theme", "fire location", "fire occurrence", "landsat", "wildland fire", "mtbs", "prescribed fire", "wildfire", "Fire and Aviation", "Open Data", "Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity"], "landingPage": "https://data-usfs.hub.arcgis.com/maps/usfs::monitoring-trends-in-burn-severity-burned-area-boundaries-feature-layer", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "modified": "2022-08-29", "programCode": ["005:059"], "publisher": {"name": "U.S. Forest Service"}, "spatial": "-166.1885,17.9474,-65.3382,70.1589", "theme": ["Geospatial"], "title": "Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity Burned Area Boundaries (Feature Layer)"}
